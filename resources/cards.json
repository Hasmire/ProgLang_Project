    "title": "Procedural and Object-Oriented Paradigms",
    "description": "PHP started as a procedural language, mirroring the style of many web applications at the time. The introduction of object-oriented features in later versions accommodated the growing complexity of web applications, providing developers with the flexibility to choose between procedural and object-oriented programming based on project requirements and coding preferences."

    "description": "PHP is an open-source language, meaning that its source code is freely available to the public. This has led to a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, share code snippets, and provide support. The open-source nature promotes collaboration and continuous improvement."

    "title": "Binding of Variables",
    "description": "PHP dynamically binds variables to data types, values, and scope. Variable binding happens at runtime, as opposed to C or Java, where variable types are bound at compile-time. This flexibility is crucial when handling user input, database queries, and dynamic content generation."
